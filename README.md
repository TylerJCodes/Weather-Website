# Weather Website
*A website where you can search for weather basically anywhere*

This is a personal project using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/poweredby/), and the **Google Maps API**. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for this project.

Many thanks to Dark Sky API, they provided an amazing resource, and was very simple to set up and start using!

## What I learned from this project

Coming from my previous project, I.E [Movie Lookup](https://github.com/TylerJDev/TylerJDev.github.io), it was a lot easier to get into this API. I had originally started this project with OpenWeatherMap API, which was great! But I found more flexibility, and it was easier for me due to the documentation. One of the biggest challenges for me for this project was *time*.. Time in the sense of time zones and what not. I was able to use the Moment.js to help me out with this, it helped a lot. It was also pretty easy to incorporate into my project.

## What's in store for this project

There's quite a few more things I need to do *(see to-do list)* with this project, but overall there isn't really anything big I will do with this in the near future. If anything comes up, this section will be updated!


## To-Do & Bugs
